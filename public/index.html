			<h4>Classic Kriegspiel:</h4>
			<p class="content">
				Kriegspiel (German for "War Game") is a chess variant of imperfect information.  The premise is that, like war, you can see your own position, but not that of your opponent.  You follow the rules of normal chess, and some information is given to you, but otherwise you must deduce where your opponents pieces are in order to win.  All information that is shared by the game is shared to both black and white.  There are many variations of Kriegspeil, and each variation reveals different information.  The more information you have, either directly or though deduction, the easier it is to win!
			</p>
			<p class="content">
				To play Kriegspiel you only need to know the rules of chess.  All moves must conform to the normal rules of chess.  When you make a move, it is announced and the turn changes - but the piece and square are not announced.  If you attempt to make an illegal move, the attempt will be announced to both players.  When it is your move, you can request 'Are there any pawn captures available?'.  If there are, you must try at least one.  When an 'impossible' move is attempted (for example moving a knight like a bishop or requesting pawn captures when there are no pawns), the action is simply ignored.				
			</p>
			<p class="content">
				Like chess, the game is over when a player is checkmated or stalemated, a draw is agreed, or a player resigns.  When the game is finished you will have the pleasure to replay the full game and see how both you and your opponent was moving (and hilarity usually ensues).  				
			</p>

				Listed below are all the possible announcements that can be shared with both players.

			<h4>Lovenheim variant:</h4>
			<p class="content">
				The Lovenheim variant was created by two Lovenheim cousins.  More intelligence can be gathered, and some is taken away.  The rules are the same as classic kriegspiel with the following exceptions: 
			</p>
			<p class="content">
				a) The origin of a check is not announced, only that a player is in check.<br />
				b) It is not announced whether a piece or pawn has been captured, only that a capture is made and on the square.<br />				
				c) When an illegal move is attempted, the attempted square is announced (but not the piece or the origin).<br />
				d) During the 'any pawn captures', if there is a valid capture and the player attempts an illegal capture - that attempted capture square is announced.<br />
				e) A player may ask if a square is occupied within a king's moving distance of any of their pieces to be announced.  The game announces 'occupied' or 'not occupied' of the square requested.  For example, if you have a pawn on e4, you may request 'occupied?' on the following squares: e5,f5,f4,f3,e3,c3,c4,c5.  The same applies for any other of your pieces.  A player may only do this once per turn, before any other requests are made.

			<h4>Rochester variant:</h4>
			<p class="content">
				The Rochester variant was what we used to play at the Rochester Chess Center when we were younger (and both lived in Rochester). The rules are the same as classic kriegspiel with the following exceptions: 
			</p>
			<p class="content">
				a) The origin of a check is not announced, only that a player is in check.<br />
				b) When a piece is captured, the actual piece name is announced.
